# UNDER WORK

# Before Word
This is a proof of concept program i designed for the enterprise i worked with, since it will not be used, I'm letting it here for anyone who wants to learn about.

# Desscription
This is a simple program that imports the lead data from active campign, it is self-updating and is meant to be used in addition to Power-BI or any other Businness inteligence program.
Bellow there is a explanation of every archive and general lines of use.<br/>
[./init](#__init.py__)<br/>
[confidential.py](#confidential.py)<br/>
[./db/__init__.py](#db/__init__.py)<br/>
[./app/__init__.py](#app/__init__.py)<br/>
[./init](#active_functions/__init__.py)<br/>



## ./__Init__.py<a name="__init.py__"> </a>
 This is a simple quick-start of the program

## ./confidential.py<a name="confidential.py"> </a>
  Here, as simple as it can be, you will insert the token and the api link. I chose to let it in a diferent archive for safety during the development ant to be easy to switch if needed
  
## ./db/__init__.py<a name="db/__init__.py"> </a>

## ./app/__init__.py<a name="app/__init__.py"> </a>

## ./active_functions/__init__.py<a name="active_functions/__init__.py"> </a>
